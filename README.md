## Overview

This project is a static landing page optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
screens. It is built without external libraries or frameworks and relies on
semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Special attention was paid to code clarity, separation of concerns, and
consistent behavior across different devices.

---

## Features

- Mobile-first, fully responsive layout (mobile / tablet / desktop)
- Header in the normal document flow (not fixed)
- Modal-based mobile navigation menu
- Anchor navigation with smooth scrolling
- Scroll-to-top button with viewport-based visibility logic
- Footer with social links and subscription form
- No external libraries or frameworks

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic and accessible markup
- **CSS3** — responsive layout, media queries, modern styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — isolated scripts, no global scope pollution

---

## Technical Notes

- JavaScript is organized into small, feature-focused scripts
- Scripts are loaded separately and isolated with IIFE to avoid global scope
  conflicts
- Event delegation is used for anchor handling inside the mobile menu
- Scroll behavior is normalized using `document.scrollingElement`
- No build tools, bundlers, or dependencies are required
